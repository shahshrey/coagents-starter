Watermarking involves embedding a secret signal to identify ownership and ensure content integrity. The article explores Google's SynthID-Text, a watermarking scheme for text, and a similar approach for generative protein design. These methods modify probability distributions during content generation to embed a statistical signature, which can later be detected to determine the origin of the content. The effectiveness of watermarking depends on its robustness and detectability without altering content quality. The article also touches on the challenges and limitations of watermarking, such as maintaining text quality and handling low entropy design tasks in protein design.\")"
